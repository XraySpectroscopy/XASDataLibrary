The XAS Data Library is designed to hold X-ray Absorption Spectra (EXAFS
and XANES) using an SQLite database, with array data encoded using JSON.
The principle goal for the library is as a proposed standard for storing
and exchanging XAS data, with implementation here intended as initial
reference and request for comments. 

The idea is provide a format and set of tools for managing Libraries of
XAFS Data, and to be able to share these libraries between different
researchers and different analysis programs.  As the the base format of the
library will be created with SQLite, the SQL syntax and any third party
software that can use SQL and SQLite will be able to explore the data in
the format.  Data in the library will be importable from and exportable to
the ASCII XAFS Data Interchange Format, which is being developed in
parallel with this effort.  Reference implementations of programmatically
interecting with the library from a few languages will be provided.  

The intention is for a stand-alone GUI Data Browser to be included in this
distribution, and for an on-line Library to be built upon this library format.
