The XAS Data Library is designed to hold X-ray Absorption Spectra (EXAFS
and XANES) using an SQLite database, with array data encoded using JSON.
The principle goal for the library is as a proposed standard for storing
and exchanging XAS data. The implementation here is intended for initial
reference and comments. 

The idea is provide a format and set of tools for managing Libraries of
XAFS Data, and to be able to share these libraries between different
researchers and different analysis programs.  As the the base format of the
library will be created with SQLite, the SQL syntax and any third party
software that can use SQL and SQLite will be able to explore the data in
the format.  In addition, reference implementations of programmatically
interecting with the library will be provided.  

Ideally, a stand-alone GUI Data Browser and an on-line Library will be
built upon such a format.
