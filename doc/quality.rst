Data and Sample Quality
--------------------------------

The XAS data here are intended to be of good quality and collected with
well-characterized samples of such general interest as to act as standards
for more complex analysis.  As with any any experimental method, there may
be imperfections or inadvertent errors in any of the individual spectra and
no guarantees are made about the quality of the data or the origin or
quality of the sample.  Use these data with caution.  Also see the ratings
section for seeing how anyone interested can comments on a particular
spectra or suite of spectra.

To better explain the data, information is included about the beamlines and
facilities (typically government-funded laboratories) where the data were
collected, and at least some of the people involved with the measurement.
This should not be viewed as an endorsement of the data or as a notice of
copyright to restrict who can use the data.
