XDI Data Format
-----------------------------

The data here use the plain-text file format defined by the XAS-community
known as the **XAFS Data Interchange Format** or XDI.  This format has been
designed to describe a single XAS spectrum in a way that conveys all the
important information needed to work with and understand that spectrum.  A
detailed description of this format can be found at
https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/blob/master/specification/spec.md
and example data files can be found in this collection or at
https://github.com/XraySpectroscopy/XAS-Data-Interchange/tree/master/data.


To import data into this library, the data must be in the XAS-Data-Interchange (XDI) format, and must have a file extension of
``.xdi``.
