.. _Spectra:

The XAS Spectrum
-----------------------------------------

The individual XAS spectrum is the basic type of data presented in X-ray
Absorption Data Library.  Each spectrum represents :math:`\mu(E)`, the
X-ray absorption coefficient, typically measured in transmission mode.
They consist of at least two arrays of numerical data with all arrays
having the same number of data points (typically a few hundred data
points).  These arrays

Suites: Tagging Related Spectra
-----------------------------------------

A suite is a collection of similar spectra. From an organizational point of
view, suites are simply tags that can be applied to spectra.  Each suite
can contain multiple spectra in the sense that each tag can be applied to
multiple spectra.

In addition, each spectra can be assigned to many suites.  With this simple
mechanism of tags, one can build complex sets of spectra, and be able to
assemble suites of something like *V oxides prepared by Person X and
measured at beamline Y*.

.. _Ratings:

Rating Spectra and Suites
-----------------------------

Any individual spectra or suites of spectra can be rated and reviewed by
any person who has logged in.  Scores can range from 0 to 5 (similar to
many on-line shopping sites), and comments or reviews on the spectrum or
suite can be made.


.. _Uploading:

Uploading Data
--------------------

To upload data, you must be logged in, and the data to load must be a   valid XDI file.
