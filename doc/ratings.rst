Rating Spectra and Suites of Spectra
----------------------------------------------

While the data in X-ray Absorption Data Library are meant to be of high
quality, we cannot actually guarantee the quality of any of the spectra
here.  It is not always clear what sort of quality would be expected.  For
example, a spectrum could be very good data, but off significantly in
energy calibration, or taken at an unusually poor energy resolution.  Such
spectra are still valuable, even if they are not of the highest quality.

Instead of trying to have one person curate the spectra here, we encourage
users and subject-matter experts to use the Ratings and Review so as to
give a community-wide curation.  If you think a particular spectrum has
problems, or that the sample used may have been contaminated, please give
a Rating and Review saying so.
