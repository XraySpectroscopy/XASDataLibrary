----------------------------------------------

The intended audience for this collection of XAS spectra is the XAS
research community or anyone trying to understand the relation between XAS
spectra and the chemical and physical state of a material or molecule.  For
such researchers, comparing XAS spectra on different materials, samples,
and chemical species is a recurring need.  It is sometimes challenging,
time-consuming, or expensive to measure "good standards" for different
sample conditions.

The data in this library have been put into the Public Domain or licensed
under the `Creative Commonz Zero
<https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/>`_
license. This allows you to use these data for any purpose, without
restrictions.  Following standard academic practices, claiming that any of
the data here is exclusively yours would not be reasonable.

As a matter of practice, each spectrum here will have at least one name
associated with it as the person who uploaded (and presumably was involved
in the collection) the data.  Most of the data here will have been
collected at government-operated national laboratories and/or with
government-funded research grants that may have policies about data sharing
and attribution. These policies are generally liberal in order to promote
public access as made available here, at least after some time.  By
uploading the data here, the submitter has agreed to grant free and
unrestricted access to this data and to follow the guidelines of the
institutions and funding agents.

If some of the XAS data here becomes an important part of your work, you
may want to contact or reference the author or their institution.  Some
spectra will have a literature citation associated with them.  You are not
obligated to cite such work in order to use the data, but you may consider
doing so.

If you wish to cite the collection as a whole, simply use the URL
https://data.xrayabsorption.org and reference the work as belonging to the
`International X-ray Absorption Society <https://xrayabsorption.org>`_.  We
will explore generating a DOI for this collection.
