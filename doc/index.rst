XASLIB: The X-ray Absorption Data Library
===================================================

This is a collection of experimentally measured X-ray Absorption Spectra.

The data here represent the enegy-depenent X-ray absorption coefficient,
:math:`\mu(E)`, around X-ray aborption edges as used for X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS, XAFS, or XANES).  XAS Spectra are available for a range
of absorbing elements in a range of materials and molecular structures.

Using the conventions of the XAS community (see, for example
https://xafs.xrayabsorption.org), the energies here are recorded in
electron-Volts (:math:`\mathrm{eV}`) while values for absorption are left
"un-normalized" - not necessarily scaled to any particular units.  Most of
the spectra here has been measured in Transmission mode, though some has
been measured in Fluorescence or other Emission modes.  See `Measurement
Modes
<https://xafs.xrayabsorption.org/acronyms.html#terms-for-measurement-modes>`_
for definitions of these modes.

This collection of data is brought to you by the
`International X-ray Absorption Society <https://xafs.xrayabsorption.org>`_.
