XASLIB: The X-ray Absorption Data Library
===================================================

This is a collection of experimentally measured X-ray Absorption Spectra.

The data here represent the enegy-depenent X-ray absorption coefficient,
:math:`\mu(E)`, around X-ray aborption edges on a range of elements and
materials as used for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, XAFS, or XANES).
Using the conventions of the XAS community, the energies here are recorded
in electron-Volts (:math:`eV`) and values for absorption are left
"un-normalized" - not necessarily scaled to any particular units.  Most of
the data will has been measured in Transmission mode, though some has been
measured in Fluorescence or other Emission modes.

See
`Measurement Modes

for definitions.
