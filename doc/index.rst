==============================================
The X-ray Absorption Data Library
==============================================

This is a collection of experimentally measured X-ray Absorption Spectra.
The data here represent the enegy-depenent X-ray absorption coefficient,
:math:`\mu(E)`, around X-ray aborption edges on a range of elements and
materials as used for X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, XAFS, or XANES).
Following the conventions used by the XAS community, the energies here are
recorded in electron-Volts (:math:`eV`) while the values for absorption are
left "un-normalized" and not necessarily scaled to any particular units.
Most of the data will have been measured in Transmission mode though some
may have been measured in Fluorescence or other Emission modes See
`Measurement Modes
<https://xafs.xrayabsorption.org/acronyms.html#terms-for-measurement-modes>`_
for definitions.
